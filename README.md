This Orthopedic Analytics Dashboard provides an overview of the performance of the Orthopedic Department in 2023. It presents key metrics such as number of patients, patient satisfaction scores(PSAT), and average wait times. The dashboard visualizes monthly data on patient scores, the number of patients served, and potential correlations between wait times and patient volume. It also allows for easy exploration of insights based on different filters, including day of the week, month, and patient gender.

## **Objectives:**

- Track Department Performance: The dashboard tracks average PSAT scores and patient satisfaction over time. It helps the department identify patterns in service quality and patient care.

- Analyze Patient Demographics: The dashboard breaks down the number of patients by age group and gender which help identifying which age groups are most frequent and enabling the department to plan better resources and staffing.

- Evaluate Wait Times: The correlation between average wait time and the number of patients is visualized, which can help the department identify peak hours and optimize staffing to reduce patient wait times.


## **Real-World Use:**

In the real world, this dashboard can be used by hospital administrators, department heads, and healthcare managers to:

- Optimize Operations: By understanding peak patient times and wait times, resources can be allocated more effectively ultimately reducing patient dissatisfaction.
